# Ultimate Pixel Championship

This project encompasses a registration wizard designed for the Ultimate Pixel Championship. It has been constructed using vanilla JavaScript and CSS only, resulting in a single-page application that operates independently of any frameworks. Within the application, there are four primary views to facilitate the user journey.

The journey starts with the "Welcome Page", which serves as the initial greeting point. Users can advance to the first step of the wizard by clicking a designated button.

In the "Choose fighter" phase, participants have the opportunity to select their preferred in-game character. After making a choice and confirming it by clicking the "Choose" button, they are directed to a form where they can both view the character's name and provide their own name and email address. The text fields within the form are equipped with JavaScript-based validation to ensure data accuracy.

If users wish to make a different character selection, they can do so seamlessly by clicking the "back" button. This action returns them to the character selection view.

Upon clicking the submit button, users are ushered into the "Booking Confirmation" view. Here, they are greeted with a message expressing gratitude for their participation, along with their provided name. Within this view, users have the option to reset the wizard.

This project presents a well-structured and engaging user registration experience tailored for the Ultimate Pixel Championship. It effectively showcases the capabilities of JavaScript and CSS in the development of a user-friendly single-page application.
